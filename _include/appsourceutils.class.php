	/**
	 * "Compress" the given source file.
	 * @param $source Content to be compressed
	 * @param $ignoreRequires Boolean to ignore \#\#requires directives if true
	 * @returns compressed source content
	 *
	 * This process involves three aspects:
     * -  The PHP Tokenizer is used to remove all redundant whitespace in the source code.  The pattern
	 *    for this code is pretty much a duplicate of the example given in the PHP documentation for 
	 *    the PHP Tokeniser. 
	 *
	 * -  Any comment lines of the form <tt>\#\#requires class \b className</tt> will be parsed and
     *    replaced by the inlined class source.
	 *
	 * -  Any comment lines of the form <tt>\#\#requires \b fileName \b function</tt> will be parsed and
     *    replaced by the inlined class source.
	 *
	 * The raison d'Ãªtre for this routine is an issue that I discuss in some of my blog articles.
	 * Most ISPs do not implement PHP opcode caching on their shared hosting service offerings.  Nor do
	 * they use mod_php or FastCGI.  Each PHP request results in
	 * -   PHP image activation (which takes of the order of 100mS)
	 *
	 * -   All source code then needs to be compiled (compiling a few thousand lines will take less 
	 *     than 1mS).
	 *
	 * -   The script then needs to be executed (In the case of my blog engine this takes perhaps 3-7 mS
	 *     on my old laptop, and most of this is in the MySQL engine executing SQL queries).
	 *
     * -   However, the performance killer is the I/O time associated with gather the source files to 
	 *     compile them.  OK, if another other request has just been executed then this file data will
	 *     still be in the server's VFAT filecache.  However, the churn on such servers is such that 
	 *     almost certainly have been flushed after a few minutes this cache will. In this case, a  
	 *     cache miss to the shared NFS storage will add another 5-10mS per file miss, and another 
	 *     50-200mS again if the file isn't in the NFS server's own memory cache and therefore retrieving 
	 *     the content will require physical disk I/O.  
     *
     * Because of this last aspect, aggregrating a dozen, say, logically separate script components, 
	 * into a single load set can materially improve request response.
	 *
	 * A lesser factor is that I use inline commenting (in this case Doxgen) to produce full code 
	 * documentation. Since the class autoloader moves loaded source into a code-cache directory,
	 * compressing on the fly, I know that I pay \a no runtime overhead for documenting properly.
